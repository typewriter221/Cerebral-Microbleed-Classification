# Cerebral-Microbleed-Classification
Cerebral Microbleed Classification is a project that aims to classify cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) using MRI sequences. CMBs are hypointense foci that can be seen on T2*-weighted and susceptible-weighted MRI sequences. These microbleeds can contribute to various medical conditions and it is important to accurately classify them for proper diagnosis and treatment. You can find the enhansive explanation on govt site here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6428007/

This project provides a tool for classifying CMBs using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable classification system that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing and treating patients with CMBs.

The classification of microbleeds is done into three categories: deep, lobar, and infratentorial.
