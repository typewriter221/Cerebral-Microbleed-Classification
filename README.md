# Cerebral-Microbleed-Classification

## Introduction

Cerebral Microbleed contributes to medical reasons. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are defined as hypointense foci visible on T2*-weighted and susceptible-weighted MRI sequences. 
For an in-depth understanding of cerebral microbleeds, you can refer to this comprehensive [government site](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6428007/).

This project is used to classify cerebral microbleeds. Microbleeds are classified into deep, lobar, and infratentorial categories.

- Refer to [Cerebral Microbleed classification.pdf](Cerebral%20Microbleed%20classification.pdf) for details.
